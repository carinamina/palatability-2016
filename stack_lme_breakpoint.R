#The experiment was measuring leaf mass for plants from populations collected at ten different latitudes. 
#I measured multiple individuals per maternal line, and multiple maternal lines per population. 
#There are not replicate populations per latitude. 
#So I need to have some nested random effects to block plants by maternal lines nested in populations. 
#I am interested in whether there is a latitudinal threshold in the response.
